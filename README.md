## 1. Description

This is a code quiz designed to test a users knowledge of the basics of JS.

When I click "Start Quiz", I am then taken to the first question.

The questions are shuffled, so if the quiz is redone, the order wil not be the same.

When I select the wrong answer, the other wrong answers are highlighted red.
When I select the right answer, it is highlighted blue.

I can then click Next to go to the next question.

After I've completed all of my questions, I can enter my initials and receive my score.

When I click Submit, I am then taken back to the main screen.

From here, I can either play again, or check my high scores.
